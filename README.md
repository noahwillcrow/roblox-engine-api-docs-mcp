# Roblox API RAG

This project's objective is to provide an automatic, regularly-updated Docker image which provides a RAG API for all of the Roblox engine's APIs and the Creator Hub's extra documentation.

The purpose is to serve as an easy-to-use, easy-to-share tool to empower LLM-based agents to have a strong knowledge-base of working with the Roblox engine, even outside of Roblox Studio itself.
